## Deployment

### DigitalOcean App Platform

#### Using the App Spec YAML

1. Create your `app-spec.yaml` file from the template:
   ```
   cp app-spec.template.yaml app-spec.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the `app-spec.yaml` file to include your actual database credentials:
   - Replace `your-db-host.example.com` with your actual database host
   - Replace `your_db_user` with your actual database username
   - Replace `your_db_name` with your actual database name
   - Replace `your_db_password` with your actual database password

3. Deploy the app using the DigitalOcean CLI:
   ```
   doctl apps create --spec app-spec.yaml
   ```

4. To update an existing app:
   ```
   doctl apps update YOUR_APP_ID --spec app-spec.yaml
   ```

> **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE**: The `app-spec.yaml` file contains sensitive database credentials. It has been added to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to the repository. Always keep your credentials secure and never commit them to version control.

#### Manual Deployment

1. Create a new app on DigitalOcean App Platform
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure the app:
   - Type: Web Service
   - Source Directory: `/api-service`
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Run Command: `npm start`
   - Environment Variables: Add all variables from `.env` file

4. Deploy the app
