# Morse Typing Trainer
[![CI](https://github.com/xiangfengyepan/morse-learn/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/xiangfengyepan/morse-learn/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a fork of the original [Google/Tania Finlayson Morse code trainer](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/morse-learn). Adapted to help people with a visual impairment - but also because many people prefer Auditory Mnemoics better than visual ones for learning morse code.

Main differences:

- Uses auditory cues - for correct/wrong and auditory mnemoic hints
- Fixes a lot of problems with the original about not running in different browsers. The demo didn't reliably detect browsers/platforms.

*Use with a dot and dash keyboard keys - or map switches to these keys*

Built using [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io).

## Usage
```
npm install; // install dependencies
npm run start; // start the local webserver
npm install && npm rebuild node-sass && npm run browserify && npm run sass
; // run for production
```

## API Service

The application includes an API service for collecting analytics data. The API service is built with Express.js and connects to a MySQL database on DigitalOcean.

### Public Data Export

The application now includes a public data export feature that allows researchers and developers to access anonymized training data:

- **Data Export Page**: Visit `/data-export` for a user-friendly interface
- **JSON Export**: `/api/data-dump` - Complete dataset in JSON format
- **CSV Export**: `/api/data-dump/csv` - Spreadsheet-friendly format
- **Live Statistics**: `/api/stats` - Real-time usage statistics and analytics

All exported data is anonymized to protect user privacy while preserving learning patterns for research purposes.

### Setup and Deployment

For detailed deployment instructions, see:
- [API Service README](api-service/README.md) - For API service specific setup
- [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) - For unified deployment of both the static site and API service

The application can be deployed as a single app on DigitalOcean App Platform, with both the static site and API service components working together.
